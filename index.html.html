<section id="education">
    <h2>Educational Background</h2>
    I recently completed my Class 12 education at satmile high school, where I focused on science. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a strong interest in mathematics , physics , chemistry, computer science, which has shaped my future aspirations.

    During my time in school, I was actively involved in various extracurricular activities, including football , cricket . These experiences not only enhanced my teamwork and leadership skills but also helped me grow personally and academically.
    
    I am now excited to pursue higher education in engineering, where I hope to further develop my skills and knowledge. My goal is to do Mtech in IIT, and I am eager to embark on this new chapter of my educational journey</p>

<section id="experience">
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>As a recent graduate of Class 12, my formal work experience is limited; however, I have gained valuable skills and insights through various academic projects and extracurricular activities.

        During my time at satmile high school , I actively participated in hackathon , where I honed my abilities in teamwork, communication, and leadership. These experiences taught me how to collaborate effectively with peers and develop strong organizational skills.

<section id="publications">
    <h2>Paper/Patent Publications</h2>
    <p>### Paper/Patent Publications

        I authored a research paper titled THE Black hole on Gravitational Pull: Black holes have an incredibly strong gravitational pull, so strong that not even light can escape once it crosses the event horizon.

        Formation: They typically form from the remnants of massive stars after they exhaust their nuclear fuel and undergo a supernova explosion.
        
        Types: There are several types of black holes: stellar (formed from stars), supermassive (found at the centers of galaxies, containing millions to billions of solar masses), and intermediate (with masses between stellar and supermassive).
        
        Spaghettification: The intense gravitational gradient near a black hole can stretch and compress objects in a process known as spaghettification, where they are elongated into thin shapes.
        
        Hawking Radiation: Proposed by physicist Stephen Hawking, this theoretical radiation suggests that black holes can emit particles and eventually evaporate over incredibly long timescales.
        
        Time Dilation: Near a black hole, time behaves differently due to intense gravitational effects. To an outside observer, time appears to slow down for anything approaching a black hole.
        
        Observation: While black holes are invisible, their presence can be inferred by observing the effects they have on nearby stars and gas, such as accelerated motion or X-ray emissions from accreting matter.
        
        First Image: In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope captured the first image of a black hole's event horizon in the galaxy M87, providing a groundbreaking visual confirmation of their existence., which was published in The Astrophysical journal.  </p>
